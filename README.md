<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I really wanted to watch a movie on the first day it came out. Hence, I made a webscraper that scrapes the website once every 5 minutes, and notifies me when the movie is out.

How it works:

-   Scrapes this _particular_ website once every 5 minutes to check for all the movies in their listing.
-   Sends a message on the telegram bot that needs to be created
-   Updates that a new movie is up, as well as shows all the movies that are currently screening :smile:

This webscraper is to be used only with this _particular_ website, as the javascript elements are configured to be as such.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You will need to create a new telegram bot, and store its key in your config file. I forgot the rest of the steps tbh........

### Prerequisites

Should have done this earlier, I forgot.

### Installation

Did I mention I forgot?

Its for my personal use anyways so whatever.
